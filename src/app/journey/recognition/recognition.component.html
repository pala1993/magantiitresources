                    <p>Prasad and Sushma  Maganti and Kamran Baig of Maganti IT Resources in Naugatuck, CT joined the core Team of  BIGCT.BIZ  as an In-kind Sponsors, Assistant Developers  and Volunteer Consultants when we had just launched in 2018. Maganti
                        IT Resources immediately aligned with our Core  Mission: to provide FREE state of the art technology that gives our Connecticut businesses, non-profits, and community leaders an amplified voice and a vote year round - on the issues
                        that have the greatest impact on our ability to grow, hire employees, offer better wages and benefits and prosper in Connecticut. Additionally, Prasad and Sushma Maganti immediately saw the unlimited possibilities connected with
                        the  BIGCT.BIZ  plan to launch the first ever VERIFIED “CT FIRST” Directory that offers a free lifetime listing to all legitimately registered businesses and organizations with a validated CT TAX ID / EIN # enabling our Connecticut
                        Business to better compete locally by eliminating the ability for out-of-state and country competition and scams to buy their way ahead of local businesses. In a short time we became more than business partners... we became friends
                        on a mission to Save CT’s economy by implementing a SOLUTIONS IT platform that is built for the people of CT, and not for profit.  The Maganti family generously shares the time of their amazing Customer Relations Representative
                        Kamran Baig ( BIGCT.BIZ  Core Team Communications Volunteer) to help share the message of  BIGCT.BIZ  with the business owners and community leaders he meets throughout CT. Kamran’s passion, larger than life enthusiasm and genuine
                        love for people makes Kamran a strong advocate and priceless asset to not only the Maganti organization and  BIGCT.BIZ , but to the future of Connecticut.  Thank God for Business Owners willing to invest in the future as visionaries
                        for the greater good of all. Maganti IT Resources runs their business based on Core Valued Principals and are committed to putting the needs of their customers first.</p>

                <p>If a house has strong foundation and pillars, the house stands the test of time. My experience with Maganti IT Resources, LLC has been akin to that. I have been working with them since 2017. After my graduation, I was lucky enough to find
                    an employer such as Maganti IT who guided me through each and every step to become a software professional. They are always there for me just like a family. I strongly recommend my employer as an option to those individuals who are

                    everything found to be seamless. The Owner and the staff, especially HR were very professional and courteous in any matter I brought up with and tend to resolve quickly and amicably. I'd highly recommend MIT for any consultants that

                        I worked as a Developer for almost 8 years of which 4 years on H1b. I have had the privilege to work for Maganti IT Resources. This company has some of the best people that motivate and encourage you to do better personally/professionally and grow as
                        an individual. I have worked for quite some time with MIT and I never had a problem either when it comes to job satisfaction, salary or paper work. They are super keen on making sure all the paper work is in right order and address
                        issues in a timely manner. All I could say is as an employee I was super happy.

                <p>Thank you for the work you did with the rebrand. We have been getting very good feedback on the new website, logos and business cards. The website in particular is proving very beneficial. Having a mobile enabled site with a fully integrated
                    content management system is proving to be very useful, and also proving to be a key marketing tool to help us compete for new business. Once again, many thanks for your help and support throughout the entire process.

                <p>If a house has strong foundation and pillars, the house stands the test of time. My experience with Maganti IT Resources, LLC has been akin to that. I have been working with them since 2017. After my graduation, I was lucky enough to find
                    an employer such as Maganti IT who guided me through each and every step to become a software professional. They are always there for me just like a family. I strongly recommend my employer as an option to those individuals who are
                    looking for a right guidance to establish their career in their respective fields.</p>

                <p>I worked for Maganti IT Resources, LLC for over for 6 years and so far, the experience had been nothing less than amazing. I can concentrate on the work and need not worry about anything- everything from visa filing- paycheck- support,
                    everything found to be seamless. The Owner and the staff, especially HR were very professional and courteous in any matter I brought up with and tend to resolve quickly and amicably. I'd highly recommend MIT for any consultants that
                    look for good employer for Visa jobs/ Green Card filing to any project delivery in a timely manner.</p>

                        I worked as a Developer for almost 8 years of which 4 years on H1b. I have had the privilege to work for Maganti IT Resources. This company has some of the best people that motivate and encourage you to do better personally/professionally and grow as
                        an individual. I have worked for quite some time with MIT and I never had a problem either when it comes to job satisfaction, salary or paper work. They are super keen on making sure all the paper work is in right order and address
                        issues in a timely manner. All I could say is as an employee I was super happy.
